So streaming, in general, got very popular.
E-Sports and gaming streams are usually the most popular.
You can also find people just talking or answering questions.

But since streams go both ways, it is almost like pair programming.
Pair programming for me is one of the best things you can do to become a better coder. Also, you learn how other developers think!

Why do you think streaming for coding is not so popular?
Would you watch it?
How should it look?
General thoughts about this topic?
